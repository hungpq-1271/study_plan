# Code for life, but life is not all about coding

> From now to beginning of 2010, most of the time you will spend for coding,
>
> but, still you also need to live.

### Basic daily calculation:
1. It is claimed to be 8-hour/day job, but it is not:

    from 7 a.m to 6 a.m: it's framgia time, not yours and it is 11 HOUR!! in total.

    => try to steal from it

2. Sleep matters:

    30 mins is stealing from framgia -> need 7h30 more to add up to 8

    => 11 p.m to 6:30 a.m, try to get fit into this

3. Cooking takes time:

    around 1 hour: 7 p.m - 8 p.m

    additionally 30 min for digest

    => try to multi-task to make it efficiently:
    - cleaning your messy, clean room if possible
    - clean cat place
    - prepare tomorrow dress
    - rest by silently ignore surrounding

4. Shopping takes time:

    around 1 hour for sure: (twice/week) 6 p.m - 7 p.m

    => skip practice

5. Practive takes time:

    around 1 hour: 6 p.m - 7 p.m
    - yoga stretch (10 min)
    - running (20 min)
    - swing (10 min)
    - shower (20 min)

    => skip if overtime

    => light practice if so tired

6. Saturday

  - morning: school
  - afternoon to night: combat

    => you have to admit that a day is wasted for beautiful experience

7. Sunday:
  - think
  - do nothing
  - go home
  - shopping

### Sum up:

    you have free time from 8:30 pm to 11 pm

    30 mins for reading

    2 hours for studying, so far so good
